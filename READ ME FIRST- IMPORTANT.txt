Project Name : Self Driving Car


In order to run this project you will have to first open powershell/cmd in administrator mode in this folder then enter the command :


python Driver.py


wait for it to run once it shows server started then open the UDACITY CAR SIMULATOR and open the application in autonomous mode

the shell/cmd will then show connected and the car will start to drive on its own and the angels of steering will get printed in the shell/cmd .



Before Lauching UDACITY :-

A screen will pop up for selecting graphics and resolution 

MY SUGGESTIONS :-

KEEP RESOLUTION : 1024*768 or 800*600

Graphics : Fastest

Screen Mode : Windowed

The above gives a smooth performance , however , you are free to experiment with your own settings


NOW IF YOU ARE AN EXPLORER AND WANT TO DO MORE EXPERIMENTS 

Then I have provided the source code for generating the model too :-

.ipynb is for notebook lovers 

However , for those not familier with notebooks I have provided a .py file too that can be opened using any IDE that supports python

FEEL FREE TO DO EXPERIMENTS ON THE MODEL BY CHANGING NODES OR REMOVING LAYERS BUT DO NOT CHNAGE THE NVIDA CNN MODEL ARCHITECTURE - KINDLY REFFER TO

IMAGE I HAVE PROVIED IN THE FOLDER

TO SAVE MODEL USE THE FOLLOWING :-

GOOGLE COLAB USERS :-

model.save('enter a model name of your choice')
from google.colab import files
files.download('Your model name here')

JUPYTER NOTEBOOK USERS/OTHER PYTHON IDE USERS :-

model.save('enter a model name of your choice here')


ENJOY AND KEEP CODING !!!!!
